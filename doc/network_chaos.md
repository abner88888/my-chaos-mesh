# Network Partition
> Sample network partition ducument:
> ```yaml
> apiVersion: pingcap.com/v1alpha1
> kind: NetworkChaos
> metadata:
>   name: network-partition-example
>   namespace: chaos-testing
> spec:
>   action: partition
>   mode: one
>   selector:
>     namespaces:
>       - tidb-cluster-demo
>     labelSelectors:
>       "app.kubernetes.io/component": "tikv"
>   direction: to
>   target:
>     selector:
>       namespaces:
>         - tidb-cluster-demo
>       labelSelectors:
>         "app.kubernetes.io/component": "tikv"
>     mode: one
>   duration: "10s"
>   scheduler:
>     cron: "@every 15s"

* **action** defines the specific pod chaos action. In this case, it means network partition, represents the chaos action of network partition of pods.
* **mode** defines the mode to run chaos action.
* **selector** is used to select pods that are used to inject chaos action.
* **direction** represents the partition direction, supported direction: from / to / both.
* **target** represents network partition target.
* **duration** define the duration time for each chaos experiment. As the example shows, the network partition lasts 10 seconds.
* **scheduler** defines some scheduler rules to the running time of the chaos experiment about pods. More rule info: https://godoc.org/github.com/robfig/cron


# Network Loss / Delay / Duplicate / Corrupt

> There are 4 cases, loss, delay, duplicate and corrupt.
>
> The meanings of action, mode, selector duration, scheduler are consistent with the description in the Network Partition.
>
> Network Loss means that network packets are dropped randomly.
>> In this case, two attributes are required, loss and correlation.
>>
>> ```yaml
>> loss:
>>   loss: "25"
>>   correlation: "25"
>> ```
>> Loss represents the percentage of packet loss. The above example shows a 25% chance of parcket loss.
>>
>> Network chaos variation isn't purely random, so to emulate that there is a correlation value as well.
>
> Network Delay means to delay the sending of network messages.
>> In this case, three attributes are required, correlation, jitter and latency.
>>
>>```yaml
>>  delay:
>>    latency: "90ms"
>>    correlation: "25"
>>    jitter: "90ms"
>>```
>> Latency indicates the delay time in sending packets.
>>
>> jitter represents the jitter of the delay time.
>>
>> The above example shows that the network latency is 90ms Â± 90ms.
>
> Network duplicate means packet duplication.
>> In this case, two attributes are required, correlation and duplicate.
>>
>>```yaml
>>  duplicate:
>>    duplicate: "40"
>>    correlation: "25"
>>```
>>
>> Network duplicate is specified the same way as network loss. The parameter "Duplicate" indicates the percentage of packet duplication. And it shows that duplication rate is 40%. 
>
> Network corrupt means packet corruption.
>> In this case, two attributes are required, correlation and corrupt.
>>
>>```yaml
>>  corrupt:
>>    corrupt: "40"
>>    correlation: "25"
>>```
>>
>> Similar to the other cases described above, the parameter "corrupt" indicates the percentage of packet corruption.
