# @ui/openapi

Generate @ui/app needed codes from OpenAPI V2.

## Motivation

RFC: [OpenAPI to TypeScript API Client and Forms](https://github.com/chaos-mesh/rfcs/pull/30)

We recommend that you read the RFC to understand the motivation for writing this package,
but if you just want a quick overview, see the **TL;DR** below:

> This package mainly solves the problem of **code synchronization** and **duplicate type definition** between
> front-end and back-end by automatically generating code.
>
> We will use the `codegen` command to accomplish this task.

## Codegen

Run `yarn workspace @ui/openapi codegen -h` to see the usage of codegen:

```console
codegen.js [command]

Commands:
  codegen.js client  generate API client by @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli
  codegen.js formik  convert the definitions generated by @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli to Formik form data
```
